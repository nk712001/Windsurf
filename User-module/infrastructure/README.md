# Infrastructure as Code (IaC) â€“ User Management System

## Overview
This directory contains all infrastructure-as-code (IaC) resources for provisioning, configuring, and managing the cloud-native environments (dev, staging, prod) for the User Management System.

## Structure
- `terraform/` or `pulumi/`: Main IaC codebase (choose preferred tool)
- `modules/`: Reusable IaC modules (networking, compute, storage, secrets, logging)
- `environments/`: Parameter files for dev, staging, prod
- `scripts/`: Automation scripts for provisioning, teardown, and state management

## Best Practices
- All infrastructure is defined via version-controlled IaC.
- Environments are fully isolated (no shared resources or credentials).
- Secrets are managed via a secure vault (never hardcoded).
- All infrastructure changes are applied via CI/CD pipeline.
- Network segmentation and least-privilege access are enforced.
- Centralized logging, monitoring, and alerting are enabled.
- Compliance controls (SOC2, GDPR, etc.) are mapped and documented.

## Getting Started
1. Choose your cloud provider and IaC tool (Terraform recommended).
2. Set up remote state storage and locking (e.g., S3 + DynamoDB for AWS).
3. Parameterize environment variables for dev, staging, prod.
4. Integrate with a secrets manager (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault).
5. Add modules for networking, compute, storage, and logging.
6. Run `terraform init` / `pulumi up` to provision resources.
7. All changes must be reviewed and applied via CI/CD.

## Compliance & Security
- Regularly run compliance and security scans (e.g., tfsec, Checkov).
- Document all controls, policies, and runbooks.
- No manual changes in the cloud console.
