# User Management System â€“ Enterprise Epics

## Epic 1: Infrastructure Setup

### Description
Provision, configure, and secure the foundational cloud-native infrastructure for the User Management System using Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Ensure the environment is scalable, resilient, observable, and compliant with enterprise standards.

### Best Practices
- Use IaC tools (e.g., Terraform, Pulumi) for reproducible environments.
- Isolate environments (dev, staging, prod) with clear separation.
- Secure secrets and sensitive data using managed vaults (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault).
- Enable automated provisioning, scaling, and self-healing for containers (Kubernetes or Docker Compose).
- Enforce network segmentation and least-privilege access.
- Integrate centralized logging, monitoring, and alerting (e.g., ELK, Prometheus, Grafana).
- Ensure compliance with relevant standards (SOC2, GDPR, etc.).

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All infrastructure is provisioned via version-controlled IaC.
- [ ] Environments are isolated and reproducible.
- [ ] All secrets are managed securely and never hardcoded.
- [ ] Automated CI/CD pipeline provisions and tears down environments.
- [ ] Logging, monitoring, and alerting are enabled for all components.
- [ ] Network policies restrict access to only necessary services.
- [ ] Compliance and security scans are integrated into CI/CD.

- Enforce strict TypeScript and linting rules.
- Implement health checks and readiness probes.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Backend is built with modular, testable TypeScript code.
- [ ] API endpoints follow RESTful conventions and are documented with Swagger.
- [ ] All inputs are validated and sanitized.
- [ ] Errors are handled gracefully with consistent response formats.

Implement secure, enterprise-grade authentication and authorization mechanisms, leveraging modern identity standards and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

### Best Practices
- Support JWT/OAuth2 for stateless authentication.
- Enforce RBAC for all API endpoints.
- Apply zero-trust principles: never trust, always verify.
- Integrate with enterprise IdP (if required) for SSO.
- Store passwords using strong hashing (bcrypt or Argon2).
- Implement brute-force and account lockout protections.
- Secure cookies and tokens (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite).
- Audit all access and permission changes.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users can securely authenticate and receive JWTs.
- [ ] All endpoints enforce RBAC.
- [ ] Authentication supports password policies and brute-force protection.
- [ ] Tokens are securely stored and transmitted.
- [ ] All access and permission changes are logged.
- [ ] Integration with enterprise IdP is possible (configurable).

## Epic 4: User Management

### Description
Deliver all core CRUD operations for user records, ensuring data integrity, validation, and compliance. Support advanced features such as bulk actions, filtering, and search.

### Best Practices
- Enforce strict validation on all user fields (server/client).
- Ensure unique constraints (e.g., email) at DB and API levels.
- Support pagination, filtering, and sorting for large datasets.
- Implement optimistic locking for concurrent updates.
- Soft-delete users for auditability.
- All changes are auditable and traceable.
- Support bulk operations (e.g., bulk delete) with confirmation.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users can be created, read, updated, and deleted via API and UI.
- [ ] All user fields are validated according to business rules.
- [ ] Pagination, filtering, and search are available and performant.
- [ ] Bulk actions (delete, update) are supported.
- [ ] All changes are logged for audit.
- [ ] Soft-delete is implemented; deleted users can be restored by admins.

## Epic 5: Auditing & Compliance

### Description
Implement comprehensive auditing for all critical actions and changes, supporting regulatory compliance and traceability.

### Best Practices
- Record all create, update, delete, and permission changes with timestamps and actor info.
- Store audit logs in tamper-evident storage.
- Provide APIs and UI for audit log access (admin only).
- Retain logs according to compliance requirements.
- Integrate with SIEM solutions if required.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All critical actions are auditable with actor, action, timestamp, and before/after state.
- [ ] Audit logs are immutable and protected from tampering.
- [ ] Admins can view and filter audit logs via API/UI.
- [ ] Log retention policies are configurable and enforced.
- [ ] Compliance reports can be generated from audit data.

## Epic 6: Frontend Platform & User Experience

### Description
Build a modern, responsive, accessible frontend using React, Ant Design, and styled-components. Ensure usability, accessibility, and enterprise branding.

### Best Practices
- Use component-driven architecture with reusable UI components.
- Enforce strict TypeScript and linting rules.
- Apply responsive design for all screen sizes.
- Implement error boundaries and loading states.
- Follow accessibility (WCAG) standards (ARIA, keyboard nav, color contrast).
- Integrate with backend via Axios and typed API services.
- Use theme and global style management for branding.
- Display toast notifications for all async actions.

### Acceptance Criteria
