# User Stories â€“ Epic 1: Infrastructure Setup

## As a DevOps engineer, I want to provision all infrastructure using version-controlled IaC, so that environments are reproducible, auditable, and easy to manage.

### Description
All cloud resources (compute, network, storage, secrets, etc.) must be defined and managed via Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools, ensuring full traceability and repeatability.

### Industry Best Practices
- Use Terraform or Pulumi for all resource provisioning.
- Store IaC code in a secured, version-controlled repository.
- Enforce code review for all infrastructure changes.
- Use modules for reusability and DRY principles.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All infrastructure is defined in IaC and committed to source control.
- [ ] Changes are applied only via CI/CD pipeline.
- [ ] Manual changes in the cloud console are forbidden and monitored.

### Potential Tasks
- Set up Terraform/Pulumi project structure.
- Define cloud provider credentials and state management.
- Write IaC for VPC, subnets, compute, storage, and secrets management.
- Integrate IaC pipeline with CI/CD.

## As a platform owner, I want to isolate dev, staging, and production environments, so that changes can be safely tested and released.

### Description
Each environment must be provisioned separately with no shared resources or credentials, ensuring safe deployments and compliance.

### Industry Best Practices
- Environment isolation for security and compliance.
- Use separate state files and credentials per environment.
- Automated provisioning and teardown for ephemeral environments.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Dev, staging, and prod are fully isolated.
- [ ] No cross-environment resource sharing.
- [ ] Environment-specific variables and secrets are managed securely.

### Potential Tasks
- Parameterize IaC for multiple environments.
- Configure separate state backends and credentials.
- Automate environment creation and teardown scripts.

### Dependencies
- IaC project structure

### Priority

## As a security engineer, I want all secrets and sensitive data to be managed via a secure vault, so that no credentials are ever hardcoded or exposed.

### Description
Secrets (DB passwords, API keys, etc.) must be stored and accessed securely using managed vaults, never in code or environment files.

### Industry Best Practices
- Use AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or HashiCorp Vault.
- Enforce least-privilege access to secrets.
- Rotate secrets regularly and audit access.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] No secrets are present in code or IaC files.
- [ ] All secrets are stored and retrieved from a managed vault.
- [ ] Access to secrets is logged and auditable.

### Potential Tasks
- Integrate secrets management with IaC.
- Refactor code/config to use vault references.
- Set up audit logging for secret access.

### Dependencies
- IaC provisioning of vault service

## As a DevOps engineer, I want automated provisioning, scaling, and self-healing for containers, so that the platform is resilient and can handle load changes without manual intervention.

### Description
Containers must be orchestrated using Kubernetes or Docker Compose with auto-scaling and self-healing features enabled.

### Industry Best Practices
- Use managed Kubernetes or Docker Swarm for orchestration.
- Configure auto-scaling policies and health checks.
- Enable rolling updates and zero-downtime deployments.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Containers are orchestrated with auto-scaling and self-healing enabled.
- [ ] Health checks and liveness probes are configured.
- [ ] Platform can recover from node/pod failures automatically.

### Potential Tasks
- Write deployment manifests for orchestration platform.
- Configure auto-scaling groups and health checks.
- Test failure scenarios and recovery.

### Dependencies
- IaC for compute resources

## As a security engineer, I want network segmentation and least-privilege access enforced, so that only necessary communication is allowed between services.

### Description
Network policies must restrict traffic between services to only what is required, reducing the attack surface and ensuring compliance.

### Industry Best Practices
- Use security groups, firewalls, and network policies.
- Apply principle of least privilege for all network access.
- Regularly audit network rules.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All network access is explicitly defined and restricted.
- [ ] Unused ports and protocols are blocked.
- [ ] Network policies are reviewed and tested regularly.

### Potential Tasks
- Define network policies in IaC.
- Audit and document service communication requirements.
- Implement network segmentation and test access controls.

### Dependencies
- IaC for networking resources

## As a platform owner, I want centralized logging, monitoring, and alerting for all components, so that issues can be detected and resolved proactively.

### Description
All logs and metrics must be collected, stored, and visualized centrally, with alerts for anomalies and failures.

### Industry Best Practices
- Use ELK, Prometheus, Grafana, or cloud-native equivalents.
- Define and monitor key metrics (latency, error rate, resource usage).
- Set up alerting for critical thresholds.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All components emit logs and metrics to a central system.
- [ ] Dashboards and alerts are configured for key metrics.
- [ ] Incident response runbooks are documented.

### Potential Tasks
- Integrate logging/metrics agents with all services.
- Set up dashboards and alerting rules.
- Document incident response procedures.

### Dependencies
- Running infrastructure

## As a compliance officer, I want all infrastructure to meet SOC2, GDPR, and other relevant compliance requirements, so that the platform can pass audits and protect user data.

### Description
Infrastructure must be designed and operated in accordance with applicable compliance standards, with documentation and controls in place.

### Industry Best Practices
- Map infrastructure controls to compliance requirements.
- Automate compliance checks and evidence collection.
- Document all controls and policies.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Compliance controls are implemented and documented.
- [ ] Automated compliance scans are run regularly.
- [ ] Evidence is available for audits.

### Potential Tasks
- Map controls to IaC resources.
- Integrate compliance scanning tools.
- Maintain documentation for all controls.

### Dependencies
- Infrastructure provisioned and running
