# User Stories â€“ Epic 2: Backend Core Platform

## As a backend engineer, I want to build a modular, testable TypeScript backend, so that the system is maintainable and scalable.

### Description
Design and implement a Node.js/Express backend using TypeScript, following modular architecture for services, controllers, and routes.

### Industry Best Practices
- Apply separation of concerns and dependency injection.
- Use TypeORM for database abstraction and migrations.
- Enforce strict TypeScript and linting rules.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Backend modules are clearly separated and independently testable.
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode is enabled.
- [ ] Linting passes with no errors.

### Potential Tasks
- Scaffold backend project structure.
- Set up TypeScript config and ESLint.
- Implement modular folder structure.

### Dependencies
- Infrastructure provisioned

### Priority

## As an API developer, I want all endpoints to follow RESTful conventions and be documented with Swagger/OpenAPI, so that integration is standardized and discoverable.

### Description
Design endpoints for CRUD and statistics, using RESTful naming and resource patterns. Document all endpoints using Swagger/OpenAPI.

### Industry Best Practices
- RESTful API design (nouns, plural resources, verbs via HTTP method).
- Use OpenAPI 3.x for documentation.
- Keep docs in sync with implementation.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All endpoints follow RESTful conventions.
- [ ] Swagger docs are always up-to-date.

### Potential Tasks
- Design and implement all user endpoints.
- Integrate Swagger UI.
- Add OpenAPI annotations to routes/controllers.

### Dependencies
- Modular backend structure

## As a developer, I want all inputs to be validated and sanitized, so that the system is secure and robust.

### Description
Implement input validation middleware for all endpoints, ensuring only valid, sanitized data is processed.

### Industry Best Practices
- Use validation libraries (e.g., Joi, class-validator).
- Sanitize all user input.
- Centralize validation logic.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All endpoints have input validation middleware.
- [ ] Invalid data is rejected with clear error messages.

### Potential Tasks
- Implement validation middleware.
- Add validation schemas for all endpoints.
- Test with invalid/malicious input.

### Dependencies
- Endpoint implementation

### Priority

## As a backend engineer, I want errors to be handled gracefully with consistent response formats, so that clients can reliably interpret failures.

### Description
Centralize error handling and response formatting for all API endpoints.

### Industry Best Practices
- Use error-handling middleware.
- Standardize error response schema.
- Log errors with context.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All errors return a consistent response format.
- [ ] Error logs include context for debugging.

### Potential Tasks
- Implement error-handling middleware.
- Standardize error response contract.
- Add logging for all errors.

### Dependencies
- Endpoint and validation middleware

## As a database administrator, I want automated migrations and rollbacks, so that schema changes are safe and repeatable.

### Description
Use TypeORM migrations for all schema changes, with automated up/down scripts.

### Industry Best Practices
- Version-controlled migration scripts.
- Automated migration in CI/CD.
- Rollback support for failed migrations.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All schema changes are via migrations.
- [ ] Migrations are automated in CI/CD.
- [ ] Rollbacks are tested and documented.

### Potential Tasks
- Write initial migration scripts.
- Integrate migrations into CI/CD.
- Document rollback procedures.

### Dependencies
- Database provisioned

### Priority

## As an SRE, I want health and readiness endpoints, so that the system can be monitored and orchestrated reliably.

### Description
Expose `/health` and `/ready` endpoints for liveness and readiness checks.

### Industry Best Practices
- Use standard endpoint names.
- Return appropriate status codes and diagnostics.
- Integrate with monitoring/orchestration tools.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `/health` and `/ready` endpoints are implemented.
- [ ] Monitoring tools can query these endpoints.

### Potential Tasks
- Implement health/readiness endpoints.
- Integrate with monitoring stack.

### Dependencies
- Backend running in environment

### Priority

## As a DevOps engineer, I want the backend to be containerized and deployable via IaC, so that deployments are consistent and repeatable.

### Description
Create Dockerfile and IaC resources for backend deployment.

### Industry Best Practices
- Use multi-stage builds for Docker images.
- Parameterize config via environment variables.
- Deploy via CI/CD pipeline.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Dockerfile is present and builds successfully.
- [ ] Backend can be deployed via IaC.

### Potential Tasks
- Write Dockerfile for backend.
- Add IaC resources for service deployment.
- Integrate with CI/CD pipeline.

### Dependencies
- Infrastructure and backend codebase

### Priority
