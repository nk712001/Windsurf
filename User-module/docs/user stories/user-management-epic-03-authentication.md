# User Stories â€“ Epic 3: Authentication & Authorization

## As a user, I want to securely authenticate and receive a JWT, so that I can access protected resources.

### Description
Implement secure authentication using JWTs, supporting strong password policies and brute-force protection.

### Industry Best Practices
- Use strong password hashing (bcrypt, Argon2).
- Enforce password policies (length, complexity, rotation).
- Protect against brute-force attacks (rate limiting, lockout).

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users can register/login and receive JWTs.
- [ ] Passwords are hashed securely.
- [ ] Brute-force protection is enabled.

### Potential Tasks
- Implement registration/login endpoints.
- Add password policy enforcement.
- Integrate JWT issuance and validation.
- Add rate limiting and lockout logic.

### Dependencies
- Backend core platform

## As a developer, I want all endpoints to enforce RBAC, so that only authorized users can perform sensitive actions.

### Description
Implement role-based access control for all API endpoints, mapping roles to permissions.

### Industry Best Practices
- Apply zero-trust principles (never trust, always verify).
- Use middleware to enforce RBAC.
- Audit all permission changes.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All endpoints check user roles/permissions.
- [ ] Permission changes are logged.

### Potential Tasks
- Implement RBAC middleware.
- Define role-permission mappings.
- Add audit logging for permission changes.

### Dependencies
- Authentication implemented

## As an enterprise admin, I want to integrate with an external IdP for SSO, so that users can use enterprise credentials.

### Description
Support integration with SAML/OIDC-compliant identity providers for SSO.

### Industry Best Practices
- Use industry-standard protocols (SAML, OIDC).
- Support configuration for multiple IdPs.
- Secure token/cookie storage (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite).

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] SSO integration is available/configurable.
- [ ] Tokens/cookies are securely stored.

### Potential Tasks
- Implement SSO integration endpoints.
- Add IdP configuration options.
- Secure token/cookie storage.

### Dependencies
- Authentication core logic

### Priority
