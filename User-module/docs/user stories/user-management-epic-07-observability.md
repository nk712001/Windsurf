# User Stories â€“ Epic 7: Observability & Operations

## As an SRE, I want all services to emit structured logs and metrics, so that system health and performance can be monitored.

### Description
Implement structured logging and metrics collection for all backend and frontend services.

### Industry Best Practices
- Use log aggregation and metrics platforms (e.g., ELK, Prometheus, Grafana).
- Emit logs in a structured, machine-readable format (JSON).
- Include trace/context IDs for distributed tracing.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All services emit structured logs and metrics.
- [ ] Trace/context IDs are included in logs.

### Potential Tasks
- Integrate logging/metrics libraries in all services.
- Set up log/metrics aggregation stack.
- Add trace/context IDs to logs.

### Dependencies
- Service codebases

### Priority

## As an SRE, I want dashboards and alerts configured for critical metrics, so that issues can be detected and resolved proactively.

### Description
Set up dashboards for key metrics and configure alerting for anomalies and failures.

### Industry Best Practices
- Use Grafana or cloud-native dashboards.
- Define alert thresholds for latency, error rate, etc.
- Document runbooks for incident response.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Dashboards and alerts are configured for all critical metrics.
- [ ] Runbooks are available for common incidents.

### Potential Tasks
- Create Grafana dashboards for key metrics.
- Set up alerting rules.
- Document incident response runbooks.

### Dependencies
- Logging/metrics stack

## As an SRE, I want tracing enabled for distributed requests, so that the flow of requests across services can be monitored and debugged.

### Description
Implement distributed tracing (e.g., OpenTelemetry) across all services.

### Industry Best Practices
- Use OpenTelemetry or similar for tracing.
- Propagate trace IDs across service boundaries.
- Visualize traces in a dashboard.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Distributed tracing is enabled and visualizable.
- [ ] Trace IDs are propagated in all requests.

### Potential Tasks
- Integrate tracing libraries.
- Configure trace propagation.
- Set up trace visualization.

### Dependencies
- Service codebases

### Priority
Medium
